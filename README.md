# Meter community RPC
Load balancer configuration to handle RPC requests via community nodes

## Why
JellyPool is committed to offering services and tools for the ecosystems it collaborates with. This service was developed and maintained by the Jelly team as a gift to the Meter community.

## How to use the RPC endpoint
You can use the maintained rpc endpoint:

`https://rpc-meter-com.jellypool.xyz/`

You can use this RPC as a drop-in replacement for Meter.io's official RPC.

## How to self-host
You can self-host this image by using docker.
You can pull the latest valid image from our repository via the following command:

``docker pull ghcr.io/jellypool/meter-community-rpc:main``
